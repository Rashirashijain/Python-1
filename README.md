# [Task 1]
# Code Overview

1. Variable Initialization
   - Two variables, `a` and `b`, are initialized with the values 5 and 10, respectively.

2. Operations Performed
   - Addition: The sum of `a` and `b` is calculated and displayed.
   - Subtraction: The difference between `a` and `b` is calculated and displayed.
   - Multiplication: The product of `a` and `b` is calculated and displayed.
   - Division: The division of `a` by `b` is calculated and displayed. The result will be in float format.
## Output

The script prints the result of each operation as follows:
Addition:- 15
Subtraction:- -5
Multiplication:- 50
Division:- 0.5

# Python Program - Task 2

## Program Explanation

1. Input for First Name:
   - The program first prompts the user to enter their first name using `input()`.
   
2. Input for Second Name:
   - Next, the program prompts the user to enter their second name using `input()`.
   
3. Greeting Message:
   - The program combines the first name and second name with a space in between 
   and prints a greeting message: "Hello, [First Name] [Second Name], Welcome to the Python program."

## Code python
 Taking input for the first name from the user
   a = input("Enter First name: ")
 Taking input for the second name from the user
   b = input("Enter Second name: ")
 Printing a greeting message that includes both the first and second names
 The names are concatenated with a space in between and a welcome message is displayed
  print("Hello,", (a + " " + b), "Welcome to the python program.")
